# Week Ten Day One: Inheritance and Classes with Arrays

In this assignment, you'll be implementing various classes. 

For a warm-up today, you will first add code to [Car.java](src/main/java/Car.java) and [Bicycle.java](src/main/java/Bicycle.java). Then, you will add some code to [Client.java](src/main/java/Client.java) that carries out some very very basic testing code.

Later today, you'll write some code in [NumberSequence.java](src/main/java/NumberSequence.java). 

## Run your code with:
The easiest way to run your code is to press the play button in [Client.java](src/main/java/Client.java).

However, you can also run your code by typing the following into the Terminal.

```shell script
make run
```

Alternatively, if that doesn't work, use:

```shell script
./gradlew run
```
