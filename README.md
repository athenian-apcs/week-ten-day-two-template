# Week Ten Day Two: Classes with Arrays

In this assignment, you'll be implementing various classes. 

We will write [NumberArray.java](src/main/java/NumberArray.java) toghter. 

You will add code to [NumberSequence.java](src/main/java/NumberSequence.java). You can test that your code is working by running the code in [Client.java](src/main/java/Client.java).

## Run your code with:
The easiest way to run your code is to press the play button in [Client.java](src/main/java/Client.java).

However, you can also run your code by typing the following into the Terminal.

```shell script
make run
```

Alternatively, if that doesn't work, use:

```shell script
./gradlew run
```
